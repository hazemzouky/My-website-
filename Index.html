      "mechanical energy (kinetic energy or potential energy) is the energy of
      either an object in motion or the energy that is stored in objects by
      their position. Mechanical energy is also a driver of renewable energy.
      Many forms of renewable energy rely on mechanical energy to adequately
      produce power or convert energy."

    <h2>
      "We can define electrical energy as the energy generated by the movement
      of electrons from one point to another. The movement of charged particles
      along/through a medium (say wire) constitute current or electricity."

    <h3>
      "thermal energy refers to the energy contained within a system that is
      responsible for its temperature. Heat is the flow of thermal energy. A
      whole branch of physics, thermodynamics, deals with how heat is
      transferred between different systems and how work is done in the process
      (see the 1ˢᵗ law of thermodynamics)."

      Electromagnetic energy is radiant energy that travels in waves at the
      speed of light. It can also be described as radiant energy,
      electromagnetic radiation, electromagnetic waves, light, or the movement
      of radiation. Electromagnetic radiation can transfer of heat.
      Electromagnetic waves carry the heat, energy, or light waves through a
      vacuum or a medium from one point to another. The act of doing this is
      considered electromagnetic energy.

    <h3>
      Nuclear energy is a form of energy released from the nucleus, the core of
      atoms, made up of protons and neutrons. This source of energy can be
      produced in two ways: fission – when nuclei of atoms split into several
      parts – or fusion – when nuclei fuse together.

    <h3>
      Sound energy is the result when a force, either sound or pressure, makes
      an object or substance vibrate. That energy moves through the substance in
      waves
